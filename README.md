# Project Yoga 

A online yoga app Built in React that creates a custom yoga-workout based on your mood. In yoga theory each yogapose is connected to a different chakra or energyfield in the body, that makes the different poses helpful not only for physical exersice but also for mental wellbeing. For example yogaposes that is affecting the sakral chakra helps us with creativity, the poses connected to the solar plexus chakra affect our self confidence and so on. The app uses javascript functions to automaticly fetch random poses connected to the energyfield needed and sort them randomly into a workout-array.   

## How did I do it

I started with building a backend app with all the poses, backend for registrer and log in and images using MongoDB and Mongoose model (you can find the backend here: https://github.com/camillalof/project-mongo-api). Then I fetched it and used react, react routes and react hooks to create the app and authorization. 

If I would of had more time I would of focused more on accessability and used props to create less repetitive code. I also feel that a easier way to work with the routs would of been using styled components instead of vanilla CSS.
